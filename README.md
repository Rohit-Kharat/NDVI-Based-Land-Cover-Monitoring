# NDVI-Based Land Cover Monitoring 🌍📡

This project focuses on land and vegetation monitoring using the
**Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** derived from
**Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**.

## 📌 Objective
- Analyze vegetation health
- Monitor land cover changes
- Detect seasonal and temporal variations using NDVI

## 🛰️ Data Source
- Sentinel-2 Multispectral Satellite Imagery (ESA Copernicus Program)

## 📐 NDVI Formula
NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Sentinel-2
- Rasterio / GDAL
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Geospatial Analysis Tools

## 📊 Features
- NDVI computation
- Vegetation health visualization
- Land cover monitoring
- Change detection (temporal analysis)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is for educational and research purposes only.
Not intended for real-world agricultural decision-making.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Crop classification
- Drought monitoring
- Integration with ML models
- Web-based NDVI dashboard
